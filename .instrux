Wishlist 
	
	project: Create a simple Wishlist application where people can create their own wishlist and share this with their friends. Their friends will be able to choose a specific wishlist item that they will buy.

	• Simple Login/Register without account activation
	• CRUD Wishlist (for organizers)
		- Name of wishlist
		- Organizer
		- Shareable link
		
	• CRUD Wishlist items (for organizer)
		- Name
		- Description (optional)
		- Price (price)
		- Image (optional)
			> Organizer should be able to upload an image from his computer
			> Organizer should also be able to choose one of the 4 recommended pictures / gifs (the recommended pictures should be fetched from the Imgur API, use the name of the wishlist item as your query parameter)
		- Url (optional)
			> The url can be used to show where you can buy the item

	• Share wishlist with others
		- Other people can log in/register and select a wishlist item that they will buy. (They can only select items that haven’t been bought yet by other invitees)
			> Send e-mail to invitee to confirm he/she has chosen the specific product (use external mail server like mailjet, sendgrid …)

	• The organizer of a wishlist won’t be able to see that someone is buying a specific item of his list. Logged in invitees of the wishlist will be able to see what yet has been bought and what isn’t.
